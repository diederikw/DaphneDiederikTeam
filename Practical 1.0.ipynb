However, she soon\\n', 'made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she\\n', 'was nine feet high.\\n', \"'I wish I hadn't cried so much!' said Alice, as she swam about, trying\\n\", \"to find her way out.

Alice led the\\n', 'way, and the whole party swam to the shore.\\n', 'CHAPTER III. A Caucus-Race and a Long Tale\\n', 'They were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the bank--the\\n', 'birds with draggled feathers, the animals with their fur clinging close\\n', 'to them, and all dripping wet, cross, and uncomfortable.\\n', 'The first question of course was, how to get dry again: they had a\\n', 'consultation about this, and after a few minutes it seemed quite natural\\n', 'to Alice to find herself talking familiarly with them, as if she had\\n', 'known them all her life.

Prizes!'\\n\", 'Alice had no idea what to do, and in despair she put her hand in her\\n', 'pocket, and pulled out a box of comfits, (luckily the salt water had\\n', 'not got into it), and handed them round as prizes.
