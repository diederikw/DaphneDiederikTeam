camera;I purchased the 20d in Feb 2011, around 7 years after it was first introduced. The camera was so good built that it looked like new and seemed like it will last another 5 years. I bought it for less than $300 which was completely worthy of every bucks spent. This one is probably the cheapest used dslr you can find. However, remember that it was designed for semi-pro level photographers. It may lack some basic features found in modern cameras like live-view, recording video... The screen is also way too small but it's better than having no screen at all anyways. It is heavier compared to newer models but it is sturdy like a rock. If you are a beginner and looking for something to play with. Don't hesitate. It is the one for you. Spend less on the body so that you can invest more in lenses. Maybe in the next 2 years, when your skill is ripe, buy a better and more advanced body to go beyond the limitation.
mobilephone;It's been 3 weeks now and I've only had minor voice mail setup issues.  The phone itself is the best I've had in years.  Clear calls and it gets signals where my previous AT&T service would not.  My guess is that this is partly due to the good Nextel coverage my area gets.As for the phone...I did not particularly like the v60 series.  My flip seemed cheap and I broke the antenna really easily.  This phone feels much stronger and better constructed.  Lucky for me all of my v-series accessories fit, so there were no extra purchases needed.  I'll see what 6 months to a year brings.
laptop;I purchased this Z Series laptop about 5 months ago, its my first Sony laptop, Im a Mac fan, but not any more I guess... I gave my sister my macbook pro, and the change has been great. I was looking for fast performance and reliability, as well as light with strong battery life (6 hours in speed mode). This computer has all of that.The screen display is very sharp as well as scratch-resistant. Keyboard is very comfortable and not loud\t similar to my new Macbook.Price is MORE than fare! (once you bought it you wont regreat it)I also own a macbookpro that I bought here in Amazon (15 inch,2.53 processor,4gb ram) that I loved untill I found this one, now I found my Macbook heavier and slower compared to this pice of heaven.
laptop;When I first got this laptop (at a garage sale, broken) It was really slow and leggy so I installed Linux Mint.  Right away I noticed a huge difference but it was still not fast enough to be my daily computer so I upgraded the ram to 1gb. WOW THIS THING IS BLAZING FAST!!!!! I thought when I was testing the new ram.  But after awhile it still seemed a little slow so I read on-line and found out some cool tricks you can do to Linux to make it faster and after a little work this laptop is just as fast as my quad-core desktop. Highly recommend this laptop to anyone
mobilephone;I love this phone. I've had my own for over a year now and have since bought one for my son and for my daughter. Battery life is excellent, more features that I could dream of using. The phone camera takes OK photos (don't even try at a concert... haha) - and the more modern phones do better in this department, but I'm very satisfied. Just be forewarned. With Sprint PCS, you will encounter many dropped calls and ignorant customer service staff. I've been with Sprint for 7 years now, so I know what I'm talking about. I'd switch, but we get a really good deal through our company. But I digress... the phone is great, I highly recommmend.
camera;I purchased this camera to replace my Casio EX-Z4 which broke.  This camera takes great photos.  The controls are much easier to access than my EX-Z4.  i.e. there is a dedicated delete button, dedicated dial for choosing mode, etc...  The power button while small is much easier to press than the EX-Z4.  I was really looking for a camera with at least a 4x optical zoom because I like to take lots of wildlife photos and I can get too close to my subject.  The downside to this camera is that it's too big to slip into my pocket like the EX-Z4 and there is no cradle charger.  The camera also does not automatically shutoff when idle when attached to your computer -- which drains the battery.I purchased a 2GB SD flash card on the Internet and I'm very pleased with this camera!
camera;My perfect camera has to do two things very well.  First, it has to deliver superior results.  Second, it has to be portable.  I think this Olympus C-7000 comes the closest to perfect and this is the one that I bought.For superior results I thought I wanted a dSLR, but after handling one I realized I wouldn't often want to take something that large and vulnerable with me.The Canon G6 and S70 are the only other cameras that I took any serious interest in.  The G6 was tempting but still a little thick (especially the grip bump).  The S70 was tempting too, but still longer than the C-7000.Neither Canons offer as much zoom as the C-7000 (5x optical), though they both offer a wider angle.I gave only four stars because I still wonder how it compares to the G6 in light gathering ability.  Maybe I'll upgrade it to five stars once I settle that issue.I was determined to buy a Canon or a Nikon.  I had no thought toward buying an Olympus.  This camera impressed me enough that now Olympus has a new customer.  Nice job Olympus.
