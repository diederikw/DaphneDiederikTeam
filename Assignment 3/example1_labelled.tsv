camera	My husband bought this camera about 3 months ago and we continue to love it...wow, what an improvement over our old Canon Digital Elph. The Casio is SO easy to use: I've never even looked at the manual. Admittedly, I still have a soft spot for my (aging) Oly C-2100UZ but of course it is not pocketable like this Casio. This little workhorse gets taken anywhere and everywhere and gets a lot of use!The Casio has a HUGE LCD and it feels very sturdy. It's incredibly responsive and just feels good! I'm happy with the picture quality (quite good for a subcompact) and I didn't realize how much I would like the cradle for recharging the camera. We bought an extra battery, and haven't even needed to use it yet!
laptop	I got this notebook several months ago and I've had a great experience with it. I've had zero problems with it, and I'm very pleased with Vista as well. The one thing I would change about it is that mine takes it's sweet time booting up when I turn it on. Once it's all ready to go, however, it runs very fast. I'm sure that's something I could help by changing some settings, but it's the only negative thing I have to say about this computer. I have The Sims 2 Deluxe on here, and am very pleased with how fast the game runs on this notebook. I've had absolutely no problems with the computer handling any software I've added.We got it for a great price! And if you just need a basic, good computer, this is a good one to go with. It would be especially good for a student.
mobilephone	I have this phone for about 10 months.  The calls are clear in many places where I can't get my other service to work. I have dropped it numerous times on our concrete driveway and never had a problem other than a few scratches from the impact.  A few weeks ago I even dropped it in our pool.  As it stopped working, I called a local authorized repair shop and they told me it could not be repaired.  To save the $200 they wanted to charge me for a new phone and sign up to a new contract, I open it up and dried it well and a couple of days later it was working as before. This is the best phone I ever had!
